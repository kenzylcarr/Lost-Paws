# About The Project

**Welcome to Lost Paws!**

Lost Paws is a web application designed to help reunite lost pets with their owners. This project is developed by a group of Computer Science students at the University of Regina, located in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Our goal is to create a community-driven platform where users can report lost and found pets, browse nearby reports, and receive real-time updates. By providing an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, we aim to increase the chances of reuniting pets with their families while fostering a supportive pet-loving community.
